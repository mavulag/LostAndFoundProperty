# Lost And Found Property
"Lost and Found system addresses to solve both frequency and intensity of lost property to avoid frustration for different people".
## Problem
Out of 10 people who lose their belongings(properties) everyday, only 1 person gets them back and through informal methods which may be of help or not.

For the individual, lost property is an intense problem. For the organization, lost property is overwhelmingly frequent.
## Solution
Lost and Found Property system addresses to solve both frequency and intensity of lost property to avoid frustration for different people.
## How it works
Save time, money and space, Easy! add lost or found items into our lost and found system. We match and identify items by a number of different criteria for better accuracy in identifying the lost or found property. 

Once potential matches are generated, we automatically notify you and the person who have found your lost or misplaced property.

### Additional features:
Submitting lost or found items has never been easier, simply enter the details of the lost or found property and let our smart matching system get to work for you.
## Value Added Proposition
After user input all the important details of his/her property, user will be required to wait for the system to match the detail of that property to one that found then we will contact for either to come and take his/her property or deliver it to the owner, Hence owner of the lost property pays for the service after being assured the found item truly belongs to them and then gets it back.
## Future prospect
Apparently the website deals with material accessories but our future prospect is to also include data backup with filecoin
