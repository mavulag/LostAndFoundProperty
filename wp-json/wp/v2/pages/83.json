By visiting our web site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. Lostings, Inc. reserves the right to periodically review its privacy policies and modify or clarify such policies in any way it deems appropriate and consistent with the general guidelines set forth in this statement.<\/p>\n<h5>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY<\/h5>\n<p>You are not required to provide personally identifiable information to browse our web site. For the purposes of this privacy statement, we regard information as &#8220;personally identifiable&#8221; if the information, individually or in the aggregate, discloses the identity of a user, such as the user&#8217;s name, phone number, address or e-mail address. If you choose to utilize our services by filling out a listing, however, you are required to provide your email address and phone number and, if any fees are incurred, you will be required to submit your credit\/debit card information to pay for such fees.<\/p>\n<p>Except as set forth below, we do not share personal information with outside third parties. The nature of our services, however, require that third parties be able to contact individuals who list items on our web site. Therefore, once your listing is posted on our web site, your phone number will be available to third parties to contact you. Please refer to our User Agreement for further information on interacting with third parties regarding your listings. You always have the option to not provide personally identifiable information by choosing not to use our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share personal information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.<\/p>\n<p>Our policy is to limit access to personal information about you to employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide services to you or in order to do their jobs.<\/p>\n<h5>THE WAY WE USE INFORMATION<\/h5>\n<p>Our web site keeps track of the pages visited by our users by placing a small entry in a text file, called a &#8220;cookie&#8221; on your hard drive. &#8220;Cookies&#8221; help customize your experience at our web site by recording information from your browser, including your IP address and the pages you use to deliver content specific to your interests and to recognize your account number on return visits to our web site. The cookie contains an ID number that allows us to track the pages you&#8217;ve visited. Cookies, by themselves, do not give us access to any information which is personally identifiable about a user. We may, from time to time, use information collected from our cookies to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the web site. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have deleted your post or it has been recovered, you will no longer receive any further correspondence from our website.<\/p>\n<p>For more information regarding cookies and their use, please visit the following websites:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/home.netscape.com\/security\/basics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home.netscape.com\/security\/basics<\/a><br \/>\nor<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/insider\/internet\/articles\/security2.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.microsoft.com\/insider\/internet\/articles\/security2.htm#<\/a>cookies<br \/>\nYou are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.<\/p>\n<h5>CHOICE\/OPT-OUT<\/h5>\n<p>Our web site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the visitor. While you have the right at any time to opt-out of receiving any information from us, it is impossible for us to monitor e-mail or other communications received by you from third parties that, at your request or with consent, previously received such contact information from us.<\/p>\n<p>Certain communications from us, such as service announcements, and administrative messages, are considered part of Lostings, Inc. and you may not opt out of receiving them. Shoppers shall have an opportunity to review terms and conditions as well as privacy policy, contact information and refund policy prior to completing a transaction.<\/p>\n<h5>OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY<\/h5>\n<p>To prevent unauthorized access we use industry-standard SSL encryption to protect any data transmissions that contain your credit\/debit card information. Because no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases nor can we guarantee that information you supply won&#8217;t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that such data will always remain private.<\/p>\n<p>Your account information is password-protected. You can access your account on our site to edit the information or change your password at any time. You are responsible for all actions taken with your password, including fees incurred. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your password to any third parties.<\/p>\n<h5>TRANSACTION SECURITY<\/h5>\n<p>The transfer of the purchase details from the retailers site to Worldpay are encapsulated using our own encrypted and digitally-signed protocol. This uses a combination of standard methods such as PGP, RSA and MD5 to ensure that the information passed is secure and tamper-proof via SSL.<\/p>\n<h5>OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN&#8217;S PRIVACY<\/h5>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.<\/p>\n<h5>CONTACTING THE WEB SITE<\/h5>\n<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this web site, you can contact:<br \/>\nLostings.com<br \/>\nLostings, Inc<br \/>\n42 Broadway<br \/>\nNew York, NY 10004<br \/>\n<a href=\"mailto:support@lostings.com\">support@lostings.com<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Privacy Statement for Lostings, Inc.
